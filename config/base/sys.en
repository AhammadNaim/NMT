you know , one of the great reason travelers and one of the pleasures in ethnography research is to live with the people who still remember the old days , who still feel in the wind , touch them on the rain from the rains , tasting them into the bitter leaves of the plants .
just knowing that jaguar shamans are still traveling beyond the milky way or the importance of myths of the oldest of inuit still matter , or that in the himalayas , the buddhists still means the breathing of dharma , to call themselves the central revelation of anthropology into memory , which is the idea that the world , in which we live in an absolute sense , but only a model of reality in a particular way that our own .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive necessities .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through initiational rituals .
we have to deal with the unsustainable separation of death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo @-@ acolyths in haiti , or the warrior in the caisut desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the anden , or a carawanegg in the middle of the sahara . this happens to be the colleague that i traveled to a month ago in the desert , or even a yak shepherd of the qawanus in the world .
all these people teach us that there are other possibilities of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about orientation on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
together , the infinite cultures of the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life that wraps the earth as well as important for the earth as the biological food network you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural web as an ethnosphere , ethnosphere can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , insperations and intuitions that have been created by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are capable of as amazingly wissbegieries species .
and just as the biosphere became very discarded , this happened with the ethnosphere -- just at even greater speed .
not a biologist , for example , would claim that 50 percent or more species of extinction are just about to die , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet this -- the apocalyptic scenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is hardly equivalent to what we are known as the most optimistic number of diversity in the area of cultural diversity .
and the critical indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when each of you were born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the total of the vocabulary or a series of grammays .
one language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture will find access to the material world .
every language is like an old @-@ life forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and today from those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half are not whispered into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught little kids anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than being surrounded by silence to be one of the latest people that speak your language will not have an opportunity to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or expecting hope children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually happens to someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies , and takes the last silve of an old language with itself to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we would all talk only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language yoruba . let it be kanton .
let them be maui . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today , i would like to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere to try and understand what has actually been lost .
now there are some of us who sort of forget that when i say , i mean different possibilities of being , i mean really different possibilities .
take , for example , this child of the barasana in the norwest of the amazonas , the people of the anaconda , believe that they came up with mythologically the milky river from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively distinguished between color blue and green , because the celestial scene is the forest that people depend on .
they have a curious language , and an married signature called the linguistic exogamie : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , and the curious one of these big houses that are talked about because of the mischehen six or seven languages , however , is that you never hear someone who learns language .
they just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the orani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , which was first contacted in 1958 peaceful in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to connect , and made a severe mistake .
they were waiting shiny photos of themselves from the air , which we would evaluate as friendly gestures , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything two @-@ dimensional .
they took up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found nothing and conclusions that these visital maps of the devil , killed the five missionaries with the spear .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill outstanding with the spear .
they went through each other .
54 percent of the deaths borrowing through drilling .
we followed geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it with imprint , they gave them that one of the people turned so old that he died because of his age , and we killed it still with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species of this owned .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and filming the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies .
to make sense of this sensation , i had to make sense of , of course , about this remarkable faith in the voodoo , and voodoo is no cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i were to ask you to count the great world faiths , what would you say ?
christianum , islam , buddhism , judaism , or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the conjection was that in sub @-@ saharan africa there was no religious faith . of course , there was a and voodoo just the remaining of this very profound religious thought that came over during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
but what voodoo makes so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bears the spirits .
the spirits can conspire from under the great water , respond to the rhythm of dance to exurge the soul of the living , so that the acolyth will become a short shining moment to god .
and so the voodooists like to say , &quot; you know , you go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken by the spirit . how can you do damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo @-@ acolyths in a trancestate , the glowing coal with no burn , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that it holds when it is translated into a state of extreme arrest .
now , of all the people i met were the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia , the most extraordinary .
the offspring of the old tyrannian civilization , which populated the colombia coastal plain , and as a result of the conquest , this people moved back into an isolated volcanic mass that goes up over the caribbean coastal level .
in a bloodshed continent , these people were the only people who were never conquered from spain .
until today &apos;s day , they are governed by a ritual priesthood , but the training for priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadow world of the finernernis , in stone hills at the food of the glacier for 18 years , two periods of each nine years are selecting to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spend in the lap of their body , now spend metamorphan in the lap of 18 years in the laid .
and during that whole time , they are culturally introduced into the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day , they suddenly take out , and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun starts shining out on the tracks of the amazing beautiful landscape , all of a sudden everything you learned in the abstract practice , and the priests come back and says , &quot; you see it really , how i &apos;ve told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of the native and landscape , we either conspire rousseau and the old scaffolding of the noblen wilden , which is in its simplification a racial thought , or on the other hand , thoreau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , indigenous are neither sentimental , nor are you chosen by the nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of space for that in the malaria @-@ searching south of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , shaped an mysterious nimbus of the earth that isn &apos;t based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it will be embedded in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child is growing out of the anas that believes that the mountain is an apu spirit that determines or your fate will become a very different person , and have a different relationship with this resource or this place as a little child growing out of montana growing up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be carried .
whether it &apos;s a place of a mind or a lot of erce is irrelevant .
and what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia and i believed that these forests were there to be tortured .
that made me a different person as my friends among the kwakiutl who believe that these forests of the escaped hukuk and the curved himmals and the cannibalic spirits that were involved in the northetists of the world who were involved in their hamatsa initiation .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazonas .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the strongest psychoactive preparat from the amanas repertoire .
what ayahuasca does so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparate , but its processing . it &apos;s actually made of two different sources . on one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of betaarbolines , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen , which is going to take in just two different sources , and there &apos;s about as if there &apos;s a blue trash on your mind , but that &apos;s going to turn out of your family .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are very similar to the serotonin , dithanyltryptamin and methoxydimethane yltryptamin .
if you &apos;ve ever seen yanoma , as you snup this stuff , this substance that it contains in different ways also methoxydimethane yltryptamin .
to snup this powder is kind of like being shot out of a rig , healthy by baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i &apos;ve even been discussing with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who could unfolk the psychedelic aprea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 300s , discussing it about it . i claiming that you couldn &apos;t consider these tryptamines as hallucinogen , because at the moment you felt the impact , you &apos;re not there to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamines is that you can &apos;t be taken in disorders because , of course , through a human integration enzyme , you &apos;re going to be called monoamin oxidase , denaturized .
you can only be done in connection with some other chemicals that are used to make mao denaturic .
now the fascinating thing is that the betaarboline contained in the liane are mao @-@ inhibitors of exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to potentially potential the tryptamine . so ask itself .
how can these people come from a flora from 80,000 species of adstrinous plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we &apos;re using this great euphemism , trying and error that turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which all of you see at great distance in the forest appearing for our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how to do their taxonomy and they say , &quot; i thought you were going to have some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take every 17 varieties of full moon and you sing in a different pitch .
now , this doesn &apos;t get you a harvard ph.d. , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting trina .
now , the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult circumstances , you look at them as orginiell and colorful , you &apos;re kind of limited to the past while the real world , d.h. our world , is continuing .
so , the fact is that in 300 years you will not remember the 20th century in 300 years of the wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era we were against , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either actively accepted or passive . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new opportunities .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t hear less about sioux when they were bent and arrow tasks when americans stopped being americans , working horses and horses .
not change and technology , the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of domination .
 and wherever you look around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not undergoing . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is denial by recognizable forces that are going to go beyond their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s about the immense deforestation in the home country of penan , a nomadenpeople of southeast asia , of sarawak , which is going to be free to live in the forest now , and the proliferation of the crop , from the south asia from the south asia from the south asia , of sarather , which is , which is not the river , which is going to the river , and the mood , which is not only you &apos;re going to the ocean , which is going to its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its own to you can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t you can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t you ,
or if we go to tibet &apos;s mountains , where i recently see a lot of shaping , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinctions of people is generally convicted , but the ethnocid , the destruction of people &apos;s lifestyle , is not only not convicted , but generally and rather than celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering when you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
i once traveled with a young colleague 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china to southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear , 6,000 holy monuments that were turned into rubble and ashes , 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a follower of the panel lama .
that meant that he was instantly killed in the chinese invasion .
his uncle flew with her holiness to the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in as punishment -- for crimes to be wealthy .
he was smuggled into prison at the age of two years to hide under her rockzipboard , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the nurse , who actually realized this brave was taken into an education camp .
one day , she came out of see a armband of maos , and for that conversation , she had to be a heavy job camp for seven years .
suffering tibets can be incarcerable , but the inerable spirit of humans is something unforgeable .
and at the end , we really stand in front of an election . do we want to live in a monogue world of the monotony , or in a polygallmatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear that , while we &apos;re moving towards a fade , design , generical view , we &apos;re not only reducing the entire bandwidth of human imagination in a mindset , but that one day we wake up from a dream and forgotten that there were ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that maybe our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment , the cult of the saatkorn , the poetry of the shame set through the prosa of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face in the coming millennia .
if we ask these uncounted world cultures around the meaning of human being , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;ll be able to rediscover the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all human beings and gardens have to be able to flourish a room . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to narwhal jagd with inuits . and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government has not always gone very well with the inuit , and during the 50th years in the establishment of our rule , they were forced to go to settlements .
the grandfather of that old man refused .
the family who was afraid of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that inuit has no fear of the cold , and they used it to their advantage .
the slides of their slets were originally wrapped out of fish that was made in cartobu skin .
the grandfather of man was not afraid of the arctic night or the hurting storm .
he hatched out , and he dropped his pants out of the sea @-@ scale fur and put it into his hand , and when the feces started freezing , he formed them into the form of a knife .
he sprayed the saliva on the side of the feces knife , and when it was completely frozen , he amazed a dog .
he contained the dog , and he improvised an irr , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a sledge , took a different dog , and determined to the polar cups with the feces knife on the belt .
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of inuit and all the indigenous things in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit back in april 1999 the complete control over an area bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , who can seek repetition with its inhabitants .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all removed .
they &apos;re someone &apos;s home countries .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children become , like the dreams of our own children are part of hope .
what we &apos;re trying at national geographic ultimately is that we think politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics aren &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million people every month .
156 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we are entering a series of travels in the ethnosphere , where we take our audience to places such cultural wonder that , by the laws of it , and hopefully , you will embrace one after another the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in different ways that we can find a life in a really multicultural pluralistic world , where the wisdom of all of us can occur .
 thank you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first is as fast as possible , which is the basic work , is a new technology that we microsoft have , as part of an exception just a year ago , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can do either locally or away with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can rearse seamlessly and continue , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital computing is a camera , but this one is , for example , a scan of the library of congresslibrary , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 megapix .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the performance of a system like this constraints is the number of pixels on your screen right now . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non @-@ image data .
this is bleak house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
in fact , to prove that it &apos;s a text , and it &apos;s not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of texts and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e @-@ book .
 i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure , and the good experience is to read a real documentation of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolresolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really picks up these ideas , these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean pop @-@ ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here except to say that we &apos;re also going to contribute to that area .
but these are all streets in the u.s. .
well , it &apos;s overplenged at the top of nasa &apos;s image .
let &apos;s take something else out now .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth that really connects two different technologies together .
one is seadragon , and the other one is a very good research on computer vision , which is from noah snavely , a university student at washington university , under steve silk consulting at uw silk at uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research , which was a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that when we create this kind of viewpoint where we can go through images and make this experience of multi @-@ fold resolution .
but the spatial order of images here is actually meaning .
so the computer vision algorithms have stuck these pictures together so that they have the real space , where these images , all of them , nearby the grassi lakes , corresponded in the canadian rockies , and they see elements of stabilized dias or panoramic imaging , and these things were all relured to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i have time to show you other environments .
there are ones that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the pointment behind this technology , photosynth technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre lady who ended up in the computer with images of flickr , just give you a notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t shirts and on the university site , etc . , each one of these orange kets represented a picture that was detected as this model .
so these are all flickr images , and they all stand in a way related to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed i &apos;m going to work at microsoft at the end .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception .
i suspect you can see that these are lots of different kinds of cameras : everything is from the cell phone camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of you that all have been put together in this environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are covered by faces and so on .
there &apos;s a series of photographs somewhere -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can hire things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collecting data from all -- from the entire collective memory of what the earth looks like , visually , and everything is connected to each other .
all these photos are interconnected , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes from all over the earth .
consider this as the sequel of work by stephen lawler &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s increasing through complexity with which people use it , grows , and its use for the user is getting bigger and bigger using it .
their own photos are signed with metadata that has entered another person .
and if someone has taken the marriage and complained all of this sacred spots and shares who you are all , then my photograph of the notre dame cathedral is suddenly enriched with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive it into this space , into these metaverse , using photos of other people , and therefore doing some kind of overreaching model of the use of others .
and of course , byproduct all of this is the huge rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that were not only preserved by overwhelming or satellite images and so forth , but by collective memory .
 thank you .
do i understand it right ? her software enables you to , at a certain point in time , within the next few years , all the images that someone in the world are being used together essentially connected ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter to discover anything else .
if you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you take a search for images where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image is .
but how would it be if the image linked it to all its images ?
and then the amount of semantic interconnection and the abundance that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . contemporary congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope you &apos;re in sound with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections even if you haven &apos;t noticed those .
i want to start with what i call official dogma .
official dogma of what ?
official faith sentence of all western industrialized societies .
official dogma works like this : if our goal is maximizing the public well of our citizens , this is all about maximizing the freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaningful , an unquotable assumption for the human .
when people have freedom , every one of us is about to do things that maximize our public and nobody has to decide for us .
maximizing freedom is choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
 this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big one
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive parts and 12 balsamico @-@ essig that you could buy to make a large number of your own salad dessings in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store is right .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , a cassette player , radio , amplifier , and in this one electronics business there are so many stereo .
we can assemble 6.5 million different stereo from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could turn every phone you wanted , as long as he got from ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice in telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3 playground -- nasen @-@ haar @-@ trimmer and crgan me the lée faccles .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it in your business until now , you can be sure you &apos;re going to soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into business and ask that question .
do you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a or we could b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has those benefits and risks , and b has those benefits and risks .
 what do you want to do
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for someone who knows something -- namely the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing , and that sounds like sick , and therefore , not in the best constitution is a decision -- namely the patient knows .
there are enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy it ?
the answer is , they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to show this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity ; we invent it .
and we often reinvent ourselves as often as we want .
that means every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they were married as fast as they could , and then so quickly children got how they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they were doing after that .
today everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
should i marry later later ? should i have kids , or just make career ? &quot;
these are all inconventional questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions independently whether that means getting all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do , and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- to the randolph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the wireless lan works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all turned off , every minute in which we watch our child mutilating a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be very different from your child football game experience .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not all it was a question of choice .
and the world in which we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , paradoxically , is that instead of liberating paralysis .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study of investments in volunteer aging .
a colleague of mine had access to investing acles from vanguard , the giant subondsociety of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was every 10 investment fund that the employer took two percent off .
they offer 50 investmentonds -- 10 percent less employees participate than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investmentonds who are choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one should choose to push it tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes tomorrow .
you understand that it doesn &apos;t mean that people have to eat dog food when they retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investments in their employer .
by the non @-@ participation , they give up to 5,000 dollars a year on the employer who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it causes the world to look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it &apos;s forever , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salatsing .
so that &apos;s an effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them , one of them is , by the great choice of different salatressings , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision that would have been better , and what happens is this image preconceived alternative that it makes the decision bereues , and that bereues are negative to make it negative to the satisfaction that they made by their own decision , even good decision .
the more possibilities there are , the simpler it &apos;s nothing to regret at all , it &apos;s disappointing for the choice you meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs .
dan gilbert made a big dot this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare it .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties of alternatives you exclude , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it is august .
everybody in my close @-@ up neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he has missed the possibility of having a day @-@ to @-@ day parking lot .
oppertunisia cost sends happiness that we get through our choice , even though what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more options there are to select , the more attractive properties of these selection are consistent in the oppertunity cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s making a statement about it now , and maybe things are slow to do .
but an important point he makes : always who you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive properties , and it becomes , what they &apos;re going to do is make less attractive .
third , escalation of expectations .
that hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a way , and they bought them , and they missed them , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they were carrying them long enough and often enough washed , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so i went to buy new jeans after many years of the old tragene , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , easy or length ?
do you want to wash buttons or friction ? stone or acid wash ?
do you want to protect jeans ?
would you like to cut down far , keholy , blah blah blah ... and so on he would tell .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way the only way i used to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying all of these damned jeans , and i read the store -- and i say the truth -- with the best passenger jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what makes for a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was only in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
adding opportunities in people &apos;s lives inevitably the expectations people have about how good these possibilities are .
and this leads to less happiness with results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . because if they were to , they all didn &apos;t know what this is going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it used to be better than anything worse than anything was worse than everything was worse for people to experience experience that was a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we live wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best thing you can ever hope is as good as you expect .
you &apos;ll never be pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , are home @-@ high .
the secret to happiness -- which is what they all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographic moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but let &apos;s not always be a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seaterant jeans , if there is only one way to buy , is that if you are unsatisfied , and you wonder why who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying a disappointing , and they &apos;re asking why who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the brick , there is no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only thing , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and suicide , people have experienced disappointing because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves , you think it &apos;s your fault .
and so the image certification is that generally we &apos;re doing better objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think is right is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no choice , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choice than choosing .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that period for a long time in the choice of our public good .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a fundamental question of thinking about the thing , which allows all of these choice in the industrialized societies , is wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you whose problem isn &apos;t the too big choice .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a special problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and angry : steve levitt yesterday told you about how these expensive and hard to install car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re making worse for that .
if something that enables people to make decisions in our society to make in those societies where people would be slightly chosen , it would not only improve people &apos;s lives , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto @-@ improving application .
income distribution is going to make sure that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these great selection plains us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . &quot;
hugged fantasy , a short @-@ sighted view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the view the fish white .
because the truth is , if you break the goldfish glass , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass , so everything is possible , you lower happiness .
they increase paralysis , and they lower happiness .
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
this is almost limited to complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden is a metaphorical goldfish glass recipe for misend , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building it .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand , and at different levels .
we tried to simplify different approaches to the minimum components .
we have almost 20 years digitized . when we sequenced the humane genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate life , or whether we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma humanium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to achieve that with a smaller genome .
we managed to give it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or so , which are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all these genes that we eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way to the front is to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to variate individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
is it possible to make chemistry these really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inherent chemical material .
our steps at digitizing life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but yet , our last point would now sit on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out dna synthetic is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna for 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of informed chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killed ecoli . coli .
i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they said that they had this model exactly healthier .
they laughed more than you do .
so we think this is actually a situation where software can actually build your hardware hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in casseds of the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the casseds to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really miserable .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the error rate was a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 errors when we used the original sequence , it would never be able to go up .
one part of the design is to make pieces for 50 letters long and overlap them with other 50 @-@ letter pieces to build smaller sub @-@ units so that they fit together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we put watersigns in it .
think about it : we &apos;ve got a four @-@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of these letters -- these letters cocode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we just signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we constructed the pieces so we could just break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair them and put them together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with staps , contained the five to seven @-@ to @-@ seventh letters , adding these each other to make 24,000 letters pieces of letters to bring them back together , up to 72,000 .
in every step , we produced these pieces in the surplus so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so this looks like a basketball playoff .
if we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 base pairs -- they don &apos;t just grow them in e. coli . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we convert ourselves to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called the homologist recombination that biology uses to fix dna that can put those pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans , which is three million wheels of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it all came together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there are many of these out there .
here &apos;s a full @-@ shot of the molecule that we made using these processes -- in fact , we used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , we fit them in . we automatically add them .
this is not an electron microscopic recording it &apos;s a regular microscopic .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are footage over six seconds .
this is the audience that we just finished recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it by 10 , without distances , it would print 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you put it in eukaryonites as we do it : you just take out the nucleus and you put another in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clones .
now , archaebacteria are integrating the chromosome into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a full transplant from one cell to the other and activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species , and in fact , these two sooners are apart from each other like humans and mice , and we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome , and we set it up with enzymes to destroy enzymes around all the proteins , and it was quite amazing when we gave it to a cell -- and they &apos;ll appreciate our very enriched graph here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we tried to bring the process further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of some of it , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time have missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called restriction cyme that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has none ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was depressed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a stranger material , and so we ended up having a cell with a new chromosome .
it colored blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we gave in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferred .
it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can by changing software dna , changing things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re growing at six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today three people on this planet have existed in 1946 every year , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be challenging for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of strings of oil . these are a hundred million pockets a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all co2 from this material landing in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re starting to run into the limits of biological reality , and that of our imagination .
we now have technologies because of this fast synthesia methods to do what we call combinatorical genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimizing these processes to make octanium or drugs new vaccines , we can change with just a small team of molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a few times selection . we can select for liability to produce chemicals or fuel production , and so on .
this is a recording of real design software that we &apos;re working with , which you &apos;re actually designing with and designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation fuel .
you saw mais too ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got greenmaterials from the second and third generation that will come out pretty soon , will have much higher sugar skills , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way in which biology is going to have a huge impact without further increases in the cost of food , or limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a material of output , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go away .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first fuel of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a mile and a half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it converts co2 into methane , using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re studying whether we can use stored co2 , which could just be brought to production stores , converting co2 into fuel to power that process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moderate goals like the total petrochemical industry , right . if you could not do this at ted , where else ? a major source of energy .
but we &apos;re currently working on putting the same approaches for vaccines development .
you saw it with flu this year , we &apos;re always off a year , and we &apos;ve got a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that that can be changed by making recombined vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes today can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonites .
we are light years away from improving people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so now it &apos;s so far , and for those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
its task is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these mini @-@ big bang detectors .
i work on this one . it &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters in the wide , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction order to see the scale .
on september 10th of september , the machine went for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused immense juble in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation particles , which returned the entire track around the lhc , then deliberately with a part of the lhc collized to let a rain of particles prasude on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest jug , or this when someone visited the google page and found the front page like this .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific achievement .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these branches here -- these golden wires here here .
these wires run 13 thousand ampers when the machine runs high performance .
now , the engineers among them will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford that because when you cool them down very far , they become so @-@ called superconductors .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the room between the stars , these wires can hold the tension .
in one of the connections , between over neunthousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manual turdefect .
and so the wires heat up , and 13 thousand ampers suddenly hit electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even more impressive when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shifted around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we also did .
we removed them , we refixed them .
now they &apos;re all back on their way again .
by the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
we will turn it on , and we expect to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in some ways , accidents again refuse the debate about the value of science and engineering on such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we cross beyond our limits , is forming the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he defended the useless experiments of his teacher &apos;s lings , his apprentice was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for development of the human mind as to assume that our scientific ideas are endgoods that there are no mystery in nature that our triumes are complete and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
 thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect it to change .
however , shortcut is a little weird thing going on in my life and my career that made me rethink completely about this work .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called &quot; solid , pray , love &quot; -- that decided , unlike all my previous books in the world for some reason and became a big mega @-@ event , international best @-@ selling thing .
the result is that everywhere i come , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to go .
seriously -- well , let &apos;s go !
so for example , you get really worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never meet that success ?
are you not afraid you &apos;re going to write your whole life and never create a book that any person in the world are interested in ? never again ? &quot;
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
but it would be worse if i wouldn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told a teenager that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of attacked response i had been confronted over 20 years ago .
people said , &quot; are you not afraid to never succeed ?
are you not afraid that the humiliation of a statement is going to kill you ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to do this crafty of your life , and out of it , you &apos;re never going to die on a shell @-@ running dreams -- your mouth is filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? &quot;
that &apos;s how , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i always had it .
and i &apos;m still afraid of a lot more things that nobody would reject .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently and question me , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to be afraid of doing the work that he feels based on ?
and what exactly is going on with the creative entrepreneurial that they &apos;re making us insecure about the state of the state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a chemist in his 40 years when he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemist .
with your chemist block , john -- how are you going to do this ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists did not have given the call of alcoholy manic depression for centuries .
but we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres seem to have this reputation , mentally immensely unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds alone from the 20th century who died young and often by own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually understand suicid seemed really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said soon before his death in his last interview , &quot; each of my books has killed me a little further . &quot;
an extraordinary statement that you can do about her life .
but we &apos;re not even accepting that when we hear someone saying something like this , because we &apos;ve known these kinds of statements for so long , somehow we &apos;ve accepted the notion of so internal and collective acceptable that creativity and suffering somehow belong together and that art , at the end -- always lead to the souelenqual .
the question i &apos;d like to ask anyone here today is : is this idea for you totally fine ?
do you feel about it ? because with only one centimeter distance , i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion at all .
i find them disgusting .
and i find it dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken over the next century .
i think better if we &apos;re living our great creative encourages .
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous to start to sort of fall down this dark path of suspect -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that all i &apos;m going to write from now is going to be evaluated by the world as the work that came to my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it straight because we &apos;re all kind of friends here right now -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , drink gin , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
so after a while of reflective , i seem to be able to continue to write , to design some sort of protective psychological constructs .
now somehow , i have to figure out a way to preserve a safe distance between me and my very natural climbing about how the reaction will be on the written .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for this past year to do that , i &apos;ve also looked in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or reasonable ideas about it than we can help to deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
this search led me to the old greece country and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end again .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divinely servant spirit that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- for unexplained , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine servant spirits of creativity &quot; demons . &quot;
he &apos;s known by sokrates that he believed he would have shared a deny that he would carry on far away .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of body @-@ lose creative spirit .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that genie was this kind of magical divine being believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s artist &apos;s -- kind of like dobby , the house 11 -- the high and the artist would sort of be invisible at work and design the result .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i spoke about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the age was protected in certain ways , like , for example , too much narcissm , right ?
if your work brilliant you didn &apos;t look at anything for you , everybody knew you had that body @-@ lose genius that helped you .
when your work flew -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was a blow .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures that adopt commands from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this artist a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think that a merely person allows him to think he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the smallpox and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit of responsibility for offering them a fragile , human mind .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
it &apos;s deploying and distorting whole egos , and it creates all these unreachable expectations of success .
and i think that this success pressure has taken our artists over the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true , it &apos;s the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
 maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate rational humanism in an 18 @-@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would actually accumulate scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically , fees that people follow and feenmagic to their projects etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw is : why not ?
why not think so ?
because it makes just as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about explaining the absolutely crazy mood of the creative process .
one process that , as everybody knows who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , actually everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always stop reasonable .
in fact , sometimes he can feel straight for paranormal .
i had recently met an encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who was now over 90 years , who was poet all of her life , and she told me she grew up outside on the fields . she said she could feel like a poem on her landscape .
she said it would be like a lethernal train .
that was going to roll over the country on them .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew she could only do one like that , and that was -- in her words , &quot; run like the devil . &quot;
she ran like the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , and it was only about how she quickly had to get enough to a sheet of paper and a pen so she could capture it through donnts and captured on the sheet .
in other ways , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem rolled through her and she matched it , and she said it would move on over land , and she said , &quot; look for another poet . &quot;
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;ll never forget that part -- she said there were moments in which she almost miss it .
so she runs to the house , and she looks for the paper , and the poem drives through her , and she grabs a pen just as she goes through her , and then she said -- it was like reaching out with her other hand and getting it packaged .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it onto the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came in poem and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; that &apos;s creepy -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on . &quot;
that &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a maulanimal . to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweat me and squeeze myself and really awkward .
but even in my maulanimal art , i did this thing sometimes .
and i estimate that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came through from a source of me that i really cannot identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we relate to it without losing our minds , but keeping us on the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this can be the musician tom waits , and i was allowed to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we were talking about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the popented modern artist who tried to dominate this uncontrolled creative pulse that lived in him , and with them .
but then he got older and quiet , and he told me that one day he was driving on a highway in los angeles , and everything changed for him .
he was driving at high speed suddenly , when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that , as it often is in insperations , is very difficult for him , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s praying afterwards , but he can &apos;t touch them .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil ; he doesn &apos;t have a cassettenings .
so he starts to climb up that old climbing into him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be followed by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it . &quot;
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped listening .
he finished all the thought gang , and he did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; sorry , can you see i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , squeezing somebody else today .
go and squeele leonard cohen . &quot;
his whole labor process changed after that .
not the work itself . it continued to be as dark as eh and ever .
but the process and the heavy sticking that surrounded him was lifted as he pulled out the genius where he didn &apos;t cause anything as a trouble and then left him where he kind of came from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an internalized , agonizing thing .
there could be an actual , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and strangers , ouerable thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it saved me before .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the writing process of &quot; pray , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those crueles that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s going to be the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just come up with this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i spoke my comment towards an empty corner of the room .
i said , &quot; listen , you thing , you and i both know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my blame , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve invested everything i &apos;ve got . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to do it better , you have to check up here and hold your share of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the devil with it .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to please to protocoll that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs . &quot;
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people gathered to mondapparent dances and music collecting the stunt for hours -- until dawn .
these fests were always great because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but back and forth , very rarely , something special happened . one of the performers actually became oversecular .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such performance in your life .
it was time to stand still , and the dancers walk through a form of pest , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything was added together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be human .
he was lit up from inside and lit up from the bottom , and everything illuminated through a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
they put hands together , and they started singing , &quot; allah , allah , allah , god , god , god , god . &quot;
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic footnote : when the moore of southern spain took them to take this practice . the language changed over the centuries of &quot; allah , allah , allah , allah , &quot; olé , olé , olé , olé , &quot; which you still hear with stierco dances and flamenco dances .
if a maker in spain did something impossible , something magical : &quot; allah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo , &quot; unfiable , there &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up and realizes that 11 o &apos;clock is on a tuesday -- and he no longer carries a fifth of god .
he &apos;s only an age in mortality with painful knees , and maybe he will never rise again to these heights .
and maybe no one will ever call god &apos;s name again , when he turns around , but what will he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correction of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of pure , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence would come from you .
if you may only believe you &apos;re a lodding -- from an unimaginable source of your life that &apos;s passed on to someone else if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , that changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think certainly in the last few months , while i was working on the book that will soon appear -- as the dangerous , frightening , highly expected successes of my trigger success .
what i have to tell myself all the time when i get crazy about it is : don &apos;t scared .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
just do your job .
be still for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that you &apos;ve put on the side , decides for a brief moment to show a miracle through your effort , &quot; olé ! &quot;
and if not , your dance yet dance .
and &quot; olé ! &quot; for you despite all this .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach it .
&quot; olé ! &quot; for you all , just for having the mere human love and your own sense of being there .
 thank you
 thank you
 olé !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which had nearly three million years the size of the lower 48 states , shrinking 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very much enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time @-@ lapse recording that has happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is tagged with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter , and it shrinks in summer .
what &apos;s called permanent ice , five years old , or older , is almost like blood that freak out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
this is a problem because global warming is looking at the frozen reason around the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon that will be replaced by microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate @-@ changing materials in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we cross that critical point .
already today , in some lakes in alaska methane are challenging by itself from water .
professor katey walter at alaska has traveled with another group of work for another flat lake last winter .
 wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it make us go .
and one reason is , this enormous heat @-@ peicher warms greenland from the north .
this is an annual pigeon river .
but volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the cangerlussuaq river in souwest greenland .
if you want to know what sea level is going up through land ice melting , it goes into the sea .
these rivers are rapidly taking .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent now has a negative icebalance .
and the west antarctica , which has come up with over a few underwater islands , is especially strong in melting .
this is 20 feet of sea level , as it is greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up in the top a few years ago glacier .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
in the anas , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the amounts have expanded .
but if you look , most drinking water will fall away .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow ceiling of sierra .
this is in the basin of the store .
and the predictions you read are seriously .
this austral recognition all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the catastrophes all over the world have actually been exclusible and unprecedented .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is an entirely inhalable development pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we have produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
take a look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and both beyond indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , beside deforestation , which is 20 percent burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most likely problem .
the united states is one of the biggest pollution , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have been controversial in the last few green alternatives that have been proposed .
now , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal industries and oil dustries have spent a quarter billion dollars last calena to evaluate clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me of something .
around christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of coal lamb .
you apparently saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of america &apos;s second @-@ sized waste river .
this is what happened for christmas .
one of the commercials of the coal industry around christmas was this one .
frosty of the carbon man is a pleasure , happy burst .
there &apos;s it in skin and plenty of america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the carbon man will clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s worker , and workers stay in wage and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of massey soon .
let me say quite clearly . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry rid , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
this is one , a part of her .
at coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we set it to the top line , to spend a sizable money sum in order to get an advertising action on the way to tell the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that quiet over .
clean coal , you heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons global warming is the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
just look at it , this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , positive alternative mixes with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects them all is our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold new solution to free us from this misable situation .
providing america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
it &apos;s a plan to bring america back to work to make sure and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
utility america is new . find more out .
 this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the fastest ways of reducing our dependence of old , dirty fuels that our world is choking to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and new energy systems .
new investments to create well @-@ paid jobs .
utility america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , very quickly .
 thank you .
so i want to start asking you to come back to your childhood time when you were playing with building blocks .
as they realized how to stretch hands and reach out and move the jokes up and move , they actually learned to think about and solve problems with understanding and changing curtains .
the spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- along with my professional patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi colleagues , i began to wonder : what if we were to use computers that , instead of a mouse period , moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface ... what if we could intervene with both hands and intervene with data , and so on how we want to do it ?
so this question was so tangible that we decided to explore the answer and developed siftables .
in short , a sifable able is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , so you can just move them through the extension of hands and reach out .
and the toxables are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulate digital data .
and when these tools become physical and develop awareness for their movements , recognize each other and perceive the enemy of our transition with them , then we can start with exploration new and entertaining interactions .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this sifable is configure for the video regift , and if i put it in a direction , the video will be played forward , if i tip it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are perceiving each other .
so when i put them side @-@ by @-@ side , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surrounded by one , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movements and tendency .
so an interesting sequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like shaking color like you do with fluids .
in this case , we &apos;ve configure three foundations as color pots , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re then mixed .
if we exaggerate it , we can shake a little bit back .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast exchange , and see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , every round you get on every sifable happens to be rejected letters , and as you try to make words , they &apos;re checked by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you have a new combination of letter and new possibilities .
 thank you .
these are some of the kids who came to the media lab on flight , and i could get them to try it and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
one more interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is educated words , and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
this is our youngest concrete tester down there on the right .
it turns out he just wanted to stack the sives .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive animation .
we wanted to develop a language tool .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by lifting the sifable by the table that this character shows .
here he leaves the sun .
 the sun goes up .
now he &apos;s going to pick up a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the siftables and putting them side by side , he can interact the characters .
... his own story invent .
 hello
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evolves .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got time to show this is a music sequencer for live records that we &apos;ve recently developed and acting in the sifting voice like leadership , bass and drustuff .
each has four different variations ; you can choose which one wants to use .
and you can take these sounds into the sequence that you can then put into any patterns .
and you store it by just holding a tone sifable into a sequence @-@ sifable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it to a particular ton , and then you envy it .
and then even more aligned effects like tempo and volume that you &apos;re using to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to store the leadership voice in two sequence @-@ sifable , and put them in a row , they expand and a little more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some more drums .
and now i &apos;m going to put the filter on the drums so that i can control the effect on live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by tipping the pace in one way or another .
and now i &apos;m going to combine the filters with the barrel with something more .
i can change the sequence while she &apos;s going .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , i can improvise ; you can , you know , length or sale .
and finally , i can shut down the whole sequence by ending the volume sivenable to the left .
 thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human computer interfaces that fit better , how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we &apos;re standing on the threshold of this new generation of advertising , interacting with digital media , bringing information into our world that corresponds to our demands .
 thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to you all !
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african @-@ american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , playing on a violin who only had two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steves article on it later , a book that was filmed later , with robert downey junior , when steve lopez and jamie foxx was a nathaniel anthony apartment , the contrabassists who studied at the juilliard conservatory and whose promising career was finished by his paranoide schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read the steves book or watch the film , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnectedness that emerged between those two men , but also how music helped make that connection , and how it ended up allowed the instrument if this wordgame allows us to get the home , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr apartment in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance by beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
he was talking in a very healer and healthy ton about yo @-@ yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never make it into the baseball world series , and all of that for the passage of the first violin in the last set of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came up to talk about music , and a few days later i got an email in the state that nathaniel was interested in education for me .
i have to mention that nathaniel rejected a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electroshocks and with thoraine and handcuffs , a trauma that pursued him all his life .
as a result of this , he &apos;s now particularly prone to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes around in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and torture jellyfish of his own mind .
and at the same time , at the same time , nathaniel found himself when we first started in the walt disney concert hall , and he had lost this irre flickers in his eyes and was completely lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was scared , i didn &apos;t mean i was afraid i could lose him that he could sink into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin when i started talking about pitch and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didagogia .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence by beethoven vioinconcert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniels , there was a complete change going on .
it was like standing under the influence of an invisible arznei , a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my game .
nathaniels manic zorn turned into understanding a quiet curiosity and humility .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and he began to play some clips from violin concerts , and then asked me to end : mendelsson , tharicowski , sibelius .
and we started talking about music , starting from bach over beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartok to esa pekka .
and i realized that he had not only an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but also connected it with her a tight personal relationship .
he spoke about her with a passion and an understanding that i know only of my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles else .
by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoid , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , who became a loving , trained , in juilliard trained musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means soul health .
because the music allows him to reform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he &apos;s blowing his agonizing states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
that &apos;s why we make music , so that we put something inside of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity of reality .
and the reality of that expression is achieving all of us , moving , inspired and united .
so what nathaniel went on , so the music brought him back into a community of friends .
the triggering power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and ached him .
and i &apos;m going to play music over and over again with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney concert hall or skid row , because he reminds me of why i become musicians .
 thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have , interestingly , stole the celliest .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , tasty , good consistence , delicious , a best seller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was generated in aquakulture by the most precedented standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with that beauty for several months .
one day the boss called the company , and i asked if i could do it at an event , about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
so here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs was , how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the curlbutte , the salmon , gravity fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think it &apos;s going to be a fisherulture , a fishery , a part of our future .
many arguments against it . fisheries were polluting the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a 15 @-@ to @-@ one feeding commercial .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get a pound tuna pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well too .
so here was finally a company trying to get it right .
i wanted to support them .
at the day before the event , i called the head of public health work for the company .
 let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far outside in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollution the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste is being distributed by our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
he said that it was 2,5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on it .
and that evening , i lay in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called up the next day , shortly before the event , don .
i said , &quot; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll demand .
well , i telephone with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a proper answer , until i finally telephone with the conducting biologists .
let &apos;s also call it don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , reste , dried and processed food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chickens on fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the guidance , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i fell in love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self @-@ fair enjoyable and gutman .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually fell in love with this fish , because i swear to god who has fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn , the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine had talked about this fish for a long time .
she kind of sued us .
he came across the table with a bright , almost immune white color .
the chef had cooked him .
wait twice .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish tasty as well after it was cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
and no , it doesn &apos;t cook the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i understand underneath it .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
this is a fish elevated in the southwestern corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the coin of the river guadalquivir .
up until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they grew meat cattle on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by irrigating the country .
they built this complicated sequence of channels , and they urged water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make a difference , not economically .
 and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company was bought with environmental consciousness .
what did you do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally laid the lever .
instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they escape the channels .
they created a 11,000 hectares of fish -- bartically , seawean , shrimp , aal -- and in the process , miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are curriculated and those density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we were struggling with the wetlands and i was keuche and sweats , till my knees , and miguel holds in quiet a biologies lecture .
here he highlights a rare glitaar .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundles that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out miguel has spent most of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes down into more just people of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community was unplugged in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that i had on the night .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
 he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the physical lankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the food processing ? &quot;
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the physical lankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
the system is so healthy ; it &apos;s totally self @-@ neural .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
later on day , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film director would have demanded a stage change .
and we bent around the corner , and we had the most incredible view of thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literally pinker carpet enough of the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bars , pink .
they blow . &quot;
bad ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you drag your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
now last year , on this site , 600,000 birds , were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t there a well @-@ deighth bird population that you &apos;d like to leave up on a fish ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build applied siv , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the physical lankton .
so the pinker the belly the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success to the health of their predators .
a fish elevated , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there .
they breed 240 miles in a town , where the ground level is better for nest maintenance .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every evening , they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the controversial white line in the landroad a92 .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it 240 miles back at night ?
do you do it for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i just quoted a song by whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this sort of coated flavor .
i almost never cooked it .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t tap into fish skin at all .
she tasted sweet and pure as if you were to take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel and he nicked .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last defende before something enter into the body .
it has evolved throughout evolution to look at uncleaners . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have disputes . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures their success the success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have any uncleunits , it powers massive , because the water flows through this farm comes from the river of guadalquivir .
it &apos;s a river that uses all the things that rivers now tend to lead them with themselves , chemical pollutants , abriver of pest fought .
and if it fought through the system , and that leaves the water clean than it came in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of your predator , but a farm that literally is a water @-@ processing plant , not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it sinks in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do it too , because this love story , whatever romantic is , is also inherent .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bartically or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one that actually tastes good in food .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we are not realists , we enjoy . we are lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that are the future of good food , someone stands up somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
a billion people are going to starve today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasser unequal inequalities in distribution , not total production .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeder grain in the herbivores , harmful charges for monocultures , chemicals on earth , chicken on fish , and all the time the agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was justifiable . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is , an acquisition , an acquisition that quickly strikes ecological capital that enables exactly that production .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
now our cornchamber is threatened today , not due to the exquiring of resources , but due to degrading resources .
not through the latest mice address and tractor inventions , but through fruit land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by chains , but by forests , not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that empower every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at it , and it never produced something really good about food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for two billion years of labor .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
drives that aren &apos;t worlds for themselves , operations that are repeatedly used instead of building the operating siv , instead of just intense farmers , who are not only generators , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts too flavor .
and if i &apos;m truly honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;ll be delicious .
 thank you
if i want to approach you today , it is that the total of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its individual parts , and instead of thinking about information overlamation , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns are given , and we see so trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sterbediagram of age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter it after a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes out .
and that &apos;s because in the middle area here people are the most active , and they are the most fragile over here .
we can go out one step further and then rearrange the data and see that circular disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we move on and sorting by age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s continuing to see that this is particularly true in men .
so you realize that looking at information and data in this way reminds swimming in a vital information graph .
and if we can do that for raw data why not content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover of every single sports illustrator that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it after my talk in your room .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes coming in this encore and sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on this point where all the spending of lance armstrong shows you .
now , if i just want to get a bigger glimpse , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at anything with bicycling ? &quot;
so i step back , and i get another perspective .
now i see greg lemoon .
and so you get an idea of , if you search for this kind of information , targeted , broader , zoom in , you zoom out , you don &apos;t search or surfts .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further , which is kind of a nuts .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wipediasite and reduced it to a small summary .
the summary contains a quick overview and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the popular wipediaks .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are popular on wikipedia .
so i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i elected &apos; government , i realize that the wipediakegtheories that are most cover time magazine .
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite .
it &apos;s only to see if you take a step back and look at the whole .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can then go into time magazine &quot; people of the year , and all of them see together .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music realm .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re first surfing the web as if it &apos;s actually a net , not just page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
so i can take a step back , jump right to a specific section .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in this way , look at the whole internet course in the same way .
so i can zoom in on my course in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve given to this .
and i can sort of recover everything i &apos;ve seen today .
and when i go out one step again and look at everything , i may be able to rearrange my course to my search past . here , i &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic , here after bing , or here after live labs pivot .
and from here i can go into the page and call them up again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of the file .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around , and put the internet on its head , so instead of just going from one to the other , we &apos;re starting to go from many things to many things , and by seeing patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then this bisherous data trap , maybe a new source of meaningful information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know knowledge , we may even be able to pull wisdom from it .
 that &apos;s what i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a tied portion of science fiction .
in my school , i drove to school every day an hour per track .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts into other worlds , and in narrative ways , my deep in me was satisfied , insatiable curiosity .
and this curiosity also showed that whenever i was not in school , through the forests of stretched and sampled and samples , i looked at frogs and snakes and beetles and beetles , brought it home and looked under the microscope .
i was totally science excited , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of miracles that we could never have imagined before .
and that &apos;s probably very good at this science fiction role .
 and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it was neither video games nor this oversatiation of computer @-@ generated movies , all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the author and put it on the canvas in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and painting by alien , alien worlds , robots , spacecraft ships and all that kind of stuff .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , like i hiding behind the textbook , painted around .
creativity somehow had to get out .
and something interesting happened , because what fascinated me about jacques coustefrom shows was the idea of an entirely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never meet an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all that i &apos;d always imagined when i &apos;d read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i was a diver .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let myself out of it .
i got my father , until finally he got a dive school in buffalo , new york , exfined , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of the ymca in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that have been disputing , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of it in deaf boats .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is so rich in intriguing life , as we can possibly imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , as opposed to our own , harmful human imagination .
up to today &apos;s day , i feel deep awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love for the ocean , with the same intensity as eh and ever .
so when i went out as an adult , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner drive to tell stories , with my need to create images , to unite .
as a child , i was always drawing comic books and like that .
so movies were the way to bring images and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science fiction field , were &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
at &quot; abyss , &quot; i could connect my preference for the underwater world and dive with the filmmaking .
so basically my two passions went out .
something interesting happened at &quot; abyss , &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and that &apos;s how we had to create some sort of liquid water creature -- we took on computer @-@ generated animation , cg , back .
and what came out was the first computer @-@ generated soft engineering figure ever seen in a movie .
now , the movie didn &apos;t put money in it , exactly he was just playing his cost of production , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that went off .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , advanced technology and magic are not different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; and my next film , and so on .
together with ilm we created the guys out of liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect was coming .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but with the movie , we &apos;ve played a little more money .
and from those two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for film @-@ creating .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was at that time of the best make up- and creature designer , and it was called digital domain .
so the basic idea of this company was to skip the phase analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and start with digital productions in the same time .
so we did that , and we created a competitive advantage over time .
but in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were actually founded in creature- and human design for which we actually started the company -- slowly .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the knife in things of visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects in all new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that had been made using cg , and the main figures should be all cg . and the world should be cg .
but the knife put quite beautiful back , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to do that preliminently .
so i shifted this and made this other movie about the big ship undergoing .
i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a song epian scale , a passionate film .
but in secret , i actually wanted to dive down to the real wreck of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know that .
but i convinced her by saying , &quot; we dive to the wreck . we film the real wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
that &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good hanger for marketing . &quot;
and i transformed them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to it again that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality six months later , in which i found myself in a russian dive boat , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bulleye .
this was not a movie , not a hd , that was real .
so that really blew me away .
and the preparations were enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all sorts of things .
and i noticed how much of these deep @-@ sea things resemble a space mission .
well , they were also highly technical and endurable planning .
you get into that capsule , you float into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t do it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same thing as if i was in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was quite obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that has curiosity and science to do . it was all adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalsources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes even things that nobody had ever seen before , and for the science at the time we saw them had no words at all .
so that really changed me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i then met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice for a while full @-@ time researcher . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to &quot; bismarck , &quot; and we studied them with robots experienced .
we returned to the titanic wwreck .
we took little robots that we built that were wrapping down a fiberglass cable .
our intention was to appear in and to look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you had no means for it , so we developed the technology necessary .
well , i &apos;m now sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , and i &apos;m looking at these breeds pretty much like this , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little robotic experience through the geese of ship .
i &apos;m actually just talking about it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was in the ship wreck of the titanic .
that was the most surreal form of a déja vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i was bog at each time , i always knew what was going to be going on in the light kelet of the vehicle , since i walked out of the movie set for months at a time .
because the set was an accurate copy of the ship &apos;s building plans .
so that was a highly strange experience .
and she told me this telepresence experience that you could use such robotic avatars and put your own consciousness into the vehicle , into this different form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in some decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post @-@ humanes that i can think of as science fiction fan fan .
so after this expeditions , we started to really appreciate what we &apos;d seen down there , for example , these deep sources , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius hot that they can survive there .
at the same time , i also became very interested in space science , which was again science fiction influence from my childhood .
and so i ended up going to the people who are interested in space and nasa doing it with nasa , and planting right space missions , you &apos;re going to go to russia , you &apos;re going to go through the mission of biomedical protocoll , and on the turn , fly to the international space station and take our 3d cameras .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , i went out to take space scientist with us into the deep sea .
i took them , and i gave them access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources so they could take samples and instruments and so on .
we did a documentary movies , but we actually did science , specifically , in the world &apos;s science .
so the circle between my existence ended up as a science fiction fan , then as a child and translation into reality .
and over this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director must also lead to be a leader like a ship captain or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why am i doing that ? what is it coming out ? &quot;
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of production right now , from fame no trace .
i think i &apos;d run away between &quot; titanic , &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; somewhere i would have celebrated the nails on a beach on a towel .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these documentary films for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you do it by the task of will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there are . you do it for exploration , and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with just 10 to 12 people working uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been on lake two to three months behind each other .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the contempt that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve done a task that you can explain none of other things .
when you go back to the country , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound weakness , and the very printing , the whole technique , and the difficulties , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the other one . this is like police or soldiers who have done something in common , and you know that you can never explain someone .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply to the same leadership style , which is that you &apos;re respecting your team and earned respect in the opposite direction .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood there again with a small team of unknown terrain , and we dreamed &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
 and we became a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half period for a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half family .
it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who meant that we would have really been doing these oceans and transported them well on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more basically a way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think first of all , curiosity stands .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the tempt of your teams is more important than all the lorbeans in the world .
i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice as i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t confine yourself .
the worry other one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet on yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in art and exploring , failure has to be an alternative , because there it guarantees a trustbenefits .
no important entertaining innovation was ever committed without risk .
you must be willing to take risks like this .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to leave you with . failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may be surprised to do something because my full @-@ time employment at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we invent and provide the poorest 2 billion to a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more importantly than any other on the planet .
climate deterioration means that their saats will not grow over many years , and we rain too much or too little , and things will change as they can &apos;t stop their fragile environment .
that leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , climate change becomes terrible for you .
and also , the energy episode is very important for you .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price from one thing , the poverty reduction would be energy far more effective .
now , the energy episode has fallen over time .
in fact , the advancement society is based on energy advances .
the coal evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid rate in the electric trace , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , climate conditioners , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s halve the price -- let &apos;s hit a new barrier , and that barrier is related to co2 .
co2 warms up the planet , and co2 equation is quite clear .
they add the repulsive co2 , which leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has some very negative consequences , effects on weather , and perhaps worse , the indirectly that natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes , and so all systems come together .
now , the exact correlation between a carbon increase and the result is temperature change , and where the other consequences are , there are some unclear , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientist several times , &quot; do we really have to come down to zero ?
does not reach half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
 that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 @-@ foot high truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ foot bridge , and you can kind of squeeze it underneath .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , every year we &apos;re releasing a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons .
every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that reduce to zero .
it has been constant up so far .
just different economic changes have influenced at all , and we have to go from rapid increase and go down to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 that you want to get towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people , from the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy of every service and the co2 that will be emitted per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at every factor and think about how we get it zero .
probably one of these numbers needs to get very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s heading to nine billion , which is heading to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we may be able to reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means making these services accessible almost anyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make arguments and less , but on average , that number is going to increase every year , so more than doubling , the number of services will be provided per person .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of many different successes in the light sector , by other parts of autotypes , by building new ways in domestic building , there are lots of services , and some of the energy effort that can take some individual services down to 90 percent .
in other services , like fertilizer manufacturing , 105 00 : 05 : 05 : 56,000 -- 00 : 05 : 05 : 58,000 or air traffic or air traffic , is a lot smaller space for improvements .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might have a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even by a factor 6 .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to perhaps the very best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 being emitted per unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method emitted co2 today , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system .
 we need energy miracles .
now if i use the term miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed many of these miracles to development .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle up to a certain date .
you &apos;re usually just wrong , and some people are coming , they &apos;re not .
in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really bring this over ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks the notion of people here ?
i remembered me last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked it .
the idea became really tangible for you , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i got .
i decided that the release of fireflies would be my year @-@ old contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you assure you they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and although there are many directions that people are looking for , i really only see five who can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve lost time , getherapies and biofuels .
these might be a moderate contribution , and if they do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re intimidating , because all of them have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem to be simple , but that &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to have all the co2 that comes out of the burning of the chornstone , caught under pressure , and then somewhere camps and hoping it stays there .
there are a couple of pilot projects that can do that at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get on 100 percent , and get a agreement for restoration of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the waretime question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine of nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot volume .
so that &apos;s a tough nut .
next : nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in high @-@ regulated countries , is high , the question for security that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human contribution that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you &apos;ve got some benefits .
one is the energy density that these technologies create dramatically lower than the power plants .
these are energy farms , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , thousands of times more area than a normal power plant .
and then these sources are interrupted .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be blowing every day , and the wind isn &apos;t blowing all the time .
that &apos;s why , if you depend on these sources , you have a way of getting energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there are big challenges here , there are challenges in transmission , and if we say , the source of energy outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that energy comes from where to be different .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and to show the dimension , i looked at all sorts of batteries that are made for cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything , and i compared to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , and i found that all batteries that we &apos;re producing now could store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so what we need here is a major breakthrough , something that will be 100 more than the approaches at the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;ll say to many people , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many people here in the ted group that are already engaged .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , one named esolar has the great solar technology .
vindeaths khosla invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , travels the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear ; modular , liquid .
development has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the terrapower concept means instead of burning one part of the urans , the one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is u238 .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been reasonable to simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! in the right material approach , it looks like it worked .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste waste of today &apos;s reactors as a operating system .
instead of breaking your head about it , they just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is gradually consuming a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as the migrate wave of reactor .
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of an ortes in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the consuming uranium .
